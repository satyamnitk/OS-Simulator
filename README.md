# C++ Operating System Algorithms Project
This C++ project demonstrates the implementation and working of various algorithms used in
Operating Systems. The project covers the following key tasks:

## Process Management
- Creation of processes
- Process scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, Round Robin, Shortest Job First)

## Page Replacement Algorithms
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
- LRU (Least Recently Used)
- MRU (Most Recently Used)

## Disk Accessing Algorithms
- FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve)
- SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
- SCAN
- LOOK
  
## Getting Started
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Deepak-Kavia/Operating-System-Simulator.git
```
2. Run the .exe project
## Usage
The project provides a command-line interface to interact with different algorithm implementations.
Once you run the executable, you will be prompted to select the desired algorithm and provide any
necessary inputs. The program will then simulate the algorithm and display the results.
